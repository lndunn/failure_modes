Weather Data Generation
- weather data generated assuming wind, precip and temp are indepdent of one another. Revisit generator using MVN distribution
- Add fields derived from weather data (loading, measurements + noise)

Scenarios
- reevaluate log link function?
- generate scenarios
- read NESC codes for standards on thresholds (and what they mean) https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7526279
- read IEEE Standard C57.91 and C57.143 for info on xformer lifespan model
- 

Model Learning
- implement gibbs sampler?
    - run scenarios
- Failure rates > threshold look off. Could be an error in:
    - the link function (not adding in the constant)
    - data generation ... not sure what would be going on there
- Fix JSON write -- add comma between entries in list
    

Model Evaluation
- Compute distributions from MCMC results
    - remove burn in period
    - compare thinned vs. unthinned chains [this paper issues a soft recommendation against thinning https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00131.x]
- Compare against known distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance
- FISHER INFORMATION
- Parameter selection - remove parameters that don't converge?

    How it works:
    For each hour in the data (i.e., 10*8760 hours), do the following:
        1. Calculate the probability of observing a particular # of failures given:
            (a) ambient conditions
            (b) known failure model
        2. Calculate the probability of observing a particular # of failures given:
            (a) ambient conditions
            (b) estimated failure model
        3. Calculate the difference in the two distributions using:
            (a) difference in means
            (b) K-S statistic
            (c) other metrics of statistical distance? 
                (c1) Look for one with PHYSICAL meaning (e.g., # of unexpected pole failures)
                (c2) Want to know to what extent the average model is an over vs. an under estimates
- Generate plots
    1. Histogram with shaded areas indicating regions where the two distributions DO NOT overlap (i.e., unexpected failures)
